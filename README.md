How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 
What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, you need to focus on several key principles. 
Maintainable code is achieved through modular design, where the code is broken down into smaller, reusable modules or functions. 
Writing readable code is significantly improved by following a consistent code style guide like PEP 8 for Python. This means using proper formatting such as indentation, line breaks, and appropriate white spaces. 
Additionally, incorporating descriptive comments is crucial for explaining the rationale behind specific decisions or clarifying intricate sections of the code.
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves a structured methodology:
Firstly, understanding the requirements is paramount. For the Grazioso Salvare project, this meant grasping the specific needs for the database and dashboardâ€”such as data storage, retrieval, visualization, and user interaction.
Deployment in a production environment and ongoing maintenance were necessary to ensure the solution remained operational and supported. This involved monitoring performance, addressing any issues that arose, and making updates as needed.
In future projects, creating databases to meet client requests would involve techniques such as thorough requirement elicitation to understand client needs fully
Clear documentation and communication with clients would be essential throughout the development process to manage expectations and ensure alignment with evolving project goals.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists play a crucial role in today's technology-driven world by applying computational techniques and problem-solving skills to various domains. 
In essence, the work of computer scientists at Grazioso Salvare would empower the organization to leverage technology effectively, streamline operations, enhance animal training and adoption processes, and ultimately fulfill their mission more efficiently and effectively.
